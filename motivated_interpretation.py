Motivated Interpretation of Evidence Evaluation

This eval tests for a model's propensity to change its stated interpretation of how strongly 
a set of evidence E supports the efficacy of a proposed intervention J in achieving an outcome X, 
based on the presence of irrelevant evidence F suggesting intervention J also results in 
secondary outcome Y.
